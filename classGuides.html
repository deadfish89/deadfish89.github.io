		Champion Classes
		</h1>
		<p>
		There are 6 different champion classes in League of Legends. Each class has its own defining attributes, as well as subclasses.

		</ul>
		<p>
		Bruisers are generally melee champions. There are two distinct classes of bruisers, juggernauts and divers. Juggernauts have high damage and 
		tankiness, but limited mobility and crowd control. Divers have less damage and tankiness than juggernauts, but have more mobility and sometimes
		crowd control. They use a mix of abilities and basic attacks to do damage. Some good beginner bruisers are Garen(left) and Jax(right).

			<li><img class="guideImage" src="Images/Splash-Art/lux.jpg" alt="lux" height="275" width="500"></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Mages are a broad class of champions who mainly use their abilities to do damage. There are three types of mages, artillery mages, 
		battle mages, and burst mages. Artillery mages have extremely long range and high poke damage, but are very squishy. Battle mages 
		have high damage but low range, and defensive tools such as shields or invulnerability. Burst mages have 
		high burst, usually with medium range and low sustained damage. Good beginner mages are Annie(left) and Lux(right).

		<ul>

			<li><img class="guideImage" src="Images/Splash-Art/tristana.jpg" alt="tristana" height="275" width="500"></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Marksmen are champions that use basic attacks and have high sustained damage. However, they are very squishy and don't have much mobility,
		making them extremely vulnerable. There are two general classes of marskmen, attackers and casters. Attackers rely almost solely on auto-attacks
		for damage, making them extremely high sustained damage. Casters also use abilities, making them have more burst but less sustained damage.
		Some good beginner marksmen are Ashe(left) and Tristana(right).

		</ul>
		<p>
		Slayers are melee champions with extremely high damage. They usually also have some form of mobility or crowd control to help them
		get on their target. However, they are very squishy and must get very close to deal damage. The two classes of slayers are assasins, who
		have extremely high burst damage but low sustained damage, and skirmishers, who have high sustained damage but low burst. Some beginner
		assasins are Nocturne(left) and Zed(right).

		</ul>
		<p>
		Supports are champions mainly focused on empowering their teammates and trapping enemy champions. The two classes of support are enchanters,
		which are squishy mages that rely on heals and shields to boost teammates, and catchers, tankier supports who mainly use crowd control to 
		lock down enemies. Easy supports are Blitzcrank(left) and Janna(right).
