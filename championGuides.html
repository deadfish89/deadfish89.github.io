		Aatrox is a bruiser who is designed to deal damage while healing in return. His strengths include lots of damage as well as healing and a 
		conditional revive. However, he does not have much crowd control and only a small dash and movement speed boost, making him easily kited.

		<p>
		Ahri is a relatively easy to play mage. She has good burst, waveclear, crowd control and mobility. However, the downside is that she
		does not particularly excel at anything, and does not have much sustained damage.
